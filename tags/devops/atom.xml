        <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Recently I automated deletion of an Elastic Load Balancer and the Subnet it was in. Fairly straightforward stuff. One slight problem is that an ELB doesn&#x27;t have states. When you delete one it disappears immediately. But in the background it is still there. When you try to delete the subnet it was in you get a dependency error. After a couple of minutes it does work.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same is true if you try to delete a security group that the ELB was using.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&#x27;s going on?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
