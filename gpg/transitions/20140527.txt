OpenPGP Key Transition Statement for John Carr

I have created a new OpenPGP key and will be transitioning away from
my old key.  The old key has not been compromised and will continue to
be valid for some time, but I prefer all future correspondence to be
encrypted to the new key, and will be making signatures with the new
key going forward.

I would like this new key to be re-integrated into the web of trust.
This message is signed by both keys to certify the transition.  My new
and old keys are signed by each other.  If you have signed my old key,
I would appreciate signatures on my new key as well, provided that
your signing policy permits that without re-authenticating me.

The old key, which I am transitioning away from, is:

pub   1024D/0xD7714D55E6EEB4D9 2009-12-15 [revoked: 2015-07-30]
      Key fingerprint = 43F5 ACB4 ED4D B845 3375  54C1 D771 4D55 E6EE B4D9

The new key, to which I am transitioning, is:

pub   8192R/0xEB27AB014FB676F4 2014-05-27
      Key fingerprint = A262 1F7E 9964 9468 FBE8  1555 EB27 AB01 4FB6 76F4

The entire key may be downloaded from: https://unrouted.io/gpg/key.txt

To fetch the full new key from a public key server using GnuPG, run:

  gpg --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv-key 0xEB27AB014FB676F4

If you already know my old key, you can now verify that the new key is
signed by the old one:

  gpg --check-sigs 0xEB27AB014FB676F4

If you are satisfied that you've got the right key, and the User IDs
match what you expect, I would appreciate it if you would sign my key:

  gpg --sign-key 0xEB27AB014FB676F4

You can upload your signatures to a public keyserver directly:

  gpg --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --send-key 0xEB27AB014FB676F4

If you'd like any further verification or have any questions about the
transition please contact me directly.

To verify the integrity of this statement:

  wget -q -O- https://unrouted.io/gpg/transitions/20140527.txt|gpg --verify
