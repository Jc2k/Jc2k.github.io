One option that has popped up is ebsmount which uses custom udev rules to run your code when a new EBS volume is attached. However on Ubuntu Trusty we have upstart. Upstart has a udev bridge and so we can start a service or run a task in response to the event:\n\nWe use blkid to check if the EBS volume is formatted as ext4. If it's not then it soon will be. And then when it's formatted we can mount it. The internet aludes to an upstart event type called path-mounted that we would use to start solr when /data was mounted. This doesn't seem to work - you can work around it and generate it manually with initctl emit.\nThen the solr init script is replaced with:\n\nI totally remove /etc/init.d/jetty and add a new upstart configuration - having /etc/init.d/jetty and /etc/init/jetty.conf seems to cause sudo start jetty and sudo stop jetty to hang. Just start solr with /etc/init.d/jetty start and grap the right command line with ps aux. Stick in a -nodetach to stop in forking so it plays nice with upstarts process supervision. This also gives us a nice place to create /data/solr and ensure its writeable by the jetty user.\nDon't forget to update solr.xml to point at this new location! :wink:\n","id":"https://unrouted.uk/blog/aws-block-deviced-added/","title":"Dealing with EBS volume hotplug"},"https://unrouted.uk/blog/docker-firewall/":{"body":"One of the most annoying things with Docker has been how it interacts with iptables. And ufw. And firewalld. Most firewall solutions on Linux assume they are the source of truth. But increasingly thats not a sensible assumption. This inevitably leads to collisions - restarting the firewall or Docker will end up clobbering something. What can we do?\n\nWhilst it was possible to get it working, it was a pain. And always a bit dirty. I don't want to have to restart Docker after tweaking my firewall! Recently a new solution has presented itself and it looks like things are going to get a lot better:\n\nIn Docker 17.06 and higher, you can add rules to a new table called DOCKER-USER, and these rules will be loaded before any rules Docker creates automatically. This can be useful if you need to pre-populate iptables rules that need to be in place before Docker runs.\n\nYou can read more about it in the pull request that added it.\nSo how do we make use of that? Searching for an answer is still hard - there are 3 years of people scrambling to work around the issue and not many posts like this one yet. But by the end of this post you will have an iptables based firewall that doesn't clobber Docker when you apply it. Docker won't clobber it either. And it will make it easier to write rules that apply to non-container ports and container ports alike.\nStarting from an Ubuntu 16.04 VM that has Docker installed but has never had an explicit firewall setup before. If you've had any other sort of Docker firewall before, undo those changes. Docker should be allowed to do its own iptables rules. Don't change the FORWARD chain to ACCEPT from DROP. There is no need any more. On a clean environment before any of our changes this is what iptables-save looks like:\n\nThe main points to note are that INPUT has been left alone by Docker and that there is (as documented) a DOCKER-USER chain that has been set up for us. All traffic headed to a container goes to the FORWARD chain and this lets DOCKER-USER filter that traffic before the Docker rules are applied.\nA firewall that doesn't smoosh Docker iptables rules\nSo a super simple firewall. Create a new /etc/iptables.conf that looks like this:\n\nYou can load it into the kernel with:\n\nThat -n flag is crucial to avoid breaking Docker.\nWhats going on here?\n\n\nThis firewall avoids touching areas Docker is likely to interfere with. You can restart Docker over and over again and it will not harm or hinder our rules in INPUT, DOCKER-USER or FILTERS.\n\n\nWe explicitly flush INPUT, DOCKER-USER and FILTERS. This means we don't end up smooshing 2 different versions of our iptables.conf together. Normally this is done implicitly by iptables-restore. But its that implicit flush that that clobbers the rules that Docker manages. So we will only ever load this config with iptables-restore -n /etc/iptables.conf. The -n flag turns off the implicit global flush and only does our manual explicit flush. The Docker rules are preserved - no more restarting Docker when you change your firewall.\n\n\nWe have an explicit FILTERS chain. This is used by the INPUT chain. But Docker traffic actually goes via the FORWARD chain. And thats why ufw has always been problematic. This is where DOCKER-USER comes in. We just add a rule that passes any traffic from the external physical network interface to our FILTERS chain. This means that when I want to allow my home IP (in this example 1.2.3.4) access to every port I update the FILTERS chain once. I don't have to add a rule in INPUT and a rule in DOCKER-USER. I don't have to think about which part of the firewall a rule will or won't work in. My FILTERS chain is the place to go.\n\n\nStarting the firewall at boot\nYou can load this firewall at boot with systemd. Add a new unit - /etc/system/system/iptables.service:\n\nAnd enable it:\n\nIf your version of systemctl doesn't support this you can do it the old way:\n\nThe firewall is now active, and it didn't smoosh your docker managed iptables rules. You can reboot and the firewall will come up as it is right now.\nUpdating the firewall\nPop open the firwall in your favourite text editor, add or remove a rule from the FILTERS section, then reload the firewall with:\n\n","id":"https://unrouted.uk/blog/docker-firewall/","title":"Docker meet firewall - finally an answer"},"https://unrouted.uk/blog/elb-deletion/":{"body":"Recently I automated deletion of an Elastic Load Balancer and the Subnet it was in. Fairly straightforward stuff. One slight problem is that an ELB doesn't have states. When you delete one it disappears immediately. But in the background it is still there. When you try to delete the subnet it was in you get a dependency error. After a couple of minutes it does work.\nThe same is true if you try to delete a security group that the ELB was using.\nWhat's going on?\n\nIf you look at the Network interfaces view in the EC2 control panel after you've deleted an ELB you will see that its network interfaces still exist and are cleaned up in the background. Internally it's in a 'deleting' state, but we just can't see that in the ELB API.\nWe can simulate it to some extent by polling the network interfaces API. It turns out (thanks Andrew @ AWS support) that ELB sets the description of its ENI's to 'ELB yournamehere'. So with botocore we can do something like:\n\nThis is now done automatically when deleting an ELB with Touchdown. It won't consider an ELB deleted until all of its network interfaces have been cleaned up. So you shouldn't get any errors deleting subnets or security groups!\nSupport told me this behaviour is unlikely to change (and has been that way for at least 2 years), and they have fed back internally that the possible values for the ENI description field should be documented (they aren't right now).\n","id":"https://unrouted.uk/blog/elb-deletion/","title":"Deleting an Amazon ELB properly"},"https://unrouted.uk/blog/gemini-pda/":{"body":"I just got my hands on my Gemini yesterday. I have been looking forward to this campaign delivering for over a year (I was so excited I managed to be backer #5). It's a spiritual successor to the Psion devices I grew up with and that makes it a must have for me - even if my ultraportable Mac and iPhone have seemingly eroded any real need. So here are my first thoughts on the Pocket Computers Gemini.\nThe elephant in the room?\nA lot of the campaign backers seemed surprised and confused by the form factor. It uses mobile phone hardware and so technically can make phone calls (if you get the 4G edition). But it's true parentage is the palmtop. It's a clamshell, a teeny tiny ARM laptop. But people have been horrified you can't see caller ID without opening it and that there isn't a 32MP super camera slapped on the front.\nPersonally even if the Gemini was perfect and the software was complete it probably wouldn't ever be my 'daily driver' mobile phone. But it might mean I stopped carrying my laptop around to meetings.\nPackaging\nIt was very well packaged. Almost Apple level. The hinge mechanism on the box has a magnetic lock so its easy to open but also closes securely. The only thing that went wrong was Hermes - as you might expect - played football with it damaging one corner. Luckily the hardware itself survived.\n\n\nThe screen itself has a screen protector. It was so well applied I didn't notice it at first. With it on the touch screen worked well but had a weird texture to it. Eventually i noticed a hole in it and removed it - this was surprisingly hard work. I can't decide whether the screen protector was supposed to stay on and mine was defective or whether they need to work on making it easier to remove.\nHardware\nI tend to have realistic expectations with crowdfunding campaigns. This is a small team and whilst they have an ok budget they have a tight deadline and very very demanding backers. There is so much that the team has had to pull together to get here. In this context the hardware has blown me away. It is far better than I ever expected.\n\nMy Gemini feels solid and doesn't have that 'cheap android' feel to it that i'e come to expect from most phone manufacturers. It's got a satisfying weight to it and is well made.\nThe keyboard might not be to everyones taste but my initial feedback is well done Planet Computers. I've been typing on it for less than an hour and i've already got a decent typing speed on it. I wrote this blog post on it and other than occasionally wondering where a symbol was hiding I did not find myself pining for a full size keyboard at all.\nThe screen is lovely. The size is weird, and on top of that there is the odd alignment that I thought might be upsetting. But really I barely notice, I'm fine with it.\nThe LEDs on the outside are cute and I hope they stay in the next revision but so far I don't have a practical use for them.\nCharging only works on the left hand side. I used it with a USB-A Anker charger and it charged just fine. Apparently the USB-C chargers might be problematic but I can't confirm this (thanks mediatek).\nI used a USB A-C adaptor and tried using a mouse. It worked just fine.\nI've not had it long enough to get a feel for battery life yet.\nSoftware\nThe stock software is Android. I'm struggling so far to rationalise whether things that frustrate me are just Android (i'm an Apple fanboy) or genuine rough edges that need fixes. I haven't tried any other OS yet.\nThe Gemini boot graphics are gorgeous. I'm almost sad that I won't see them very often.\n\nThe initial setup was buggy. The biggest issue was just that Android really didn't like being landscape.\nI had thought that Material UI was a way to make web apps feel like crappy phone applications (thats certainly what I use it for), but it turns out it makes native phone apps feel like crappy web apps too (that one is on Google).\nI'm used to a single home button (and now 0 buttons on the iPhone X) so the ever present trio of buttons on the right hand side is annoying. I hope they can go away and be replaced by physical buttons / gemini app bar buttons.\nThe Gemini launcher is a great compromise at delivering the physical launcher that we had on Psion devices.\n\nI haven't figured out how to de-google things yet. Hopefully I can remove the google search window and chrome itself.\n\nSome of the Gemini specific components like the updater are clearly still work in progress, but so far they do not fit in well with the rest of the device.\n\nTL;DR\nLove it, despite the rough edges.\nThe hardware is pretty fantastic really. There are definitely things i'd ask for in v2 (bigger screen, less bezel!) but what is there is great.\nThe software is clearly still being built. I wouldn't tell non-techies to get one. But it has definitely found a place in my 'everyday carry'.\nI'd love to see a device like this running GNOME and working with GNOME Builder.\n","id":"https://unrouted.uk/blog/gemini-pda/","title":"Gemini: First thoughts"},"https://unrouted.uk/blog/git-and-walking-tags/":{"body":"I recently built a visualisation of all Django migrations in a project and the dependencies between them.

Where the original GameBoy had a GameLink socket I have a USB socket. I thought it would be a nice retro touch if i could plug a cable into 2 GameBoys in the same place and have working GameLink emulation (2 player tetris, pokemon trading, etc).\nData transfer cables like this one (i tried the USB 2 version of it) used to be popular for migrating data from an old Windows computer to a new one. These days they come with their own synchronisation software. But really they are just 2 usb network adapters connected together. On a linux box (like my GameBoy) both ends will get a new usb0 interface which you can configure any way you like.\nIn my previous post I talked about how i'd configured systemd to start some python code when the cable was plugged in. This does UDP multicast discovery (sort of like this) and writes the Gambatte core options file for both sides. And as it was a host-to-host link I just use link local addressing. But there was a hitch, obviously.\nMy first assumption was that the cable would have two proper MAC address. Like 2 real hardware network cards connected together. On testing with a raspberry pi it looked like both ends had the same mac address. That was weird and felt broken but I didn't think too much of it until I realised my link local addresses were the same on both systems. And it looked like duplicate address detection wasn't happening (presumably it assumes unique mac addresses?).\nThe first thing I tried was in systemd (its my hammer, everything is now a nail). In /etc/systemd/system/00-gamelink.link:\n\nAnd various permutations of. But none of them did anything. Sigh.\nAt first i wasn't sure I had the right [Match] stanza. I did.\nThen I wasn't sure about the name of the .link file. The sort order of .link files is important. Each device is tested against all criteria in the [Match] section and its the first .link file to match the criteria that is used. So if the sort order in use meant that 99-default.link came before gamelink.link then it would never be used. It wasn't that.\nEventually I ended up in the systemd source code. From here:\n\nSo if the MAC address is already random the policy won't do anything. The only think other than systemd that might set the mac address in my setup is the kernel itself. From here I found:\n\nA driver's init is called when the driver is loaded, not when a device is loaded. Surely it can't be this though - it seems unlikely that a module loaded at boot time would be loaded so deterministically that the mac would be the same on 2 separate systems, even if they were using the same image.\n\nAh, it's compiled in.\nForcing usbnet to be a module hides the issue. I'm not sure what this is actually doing. If usbnet is compiled in:\n\nDoes usbnet_init get called before the PRNG is initialized at all?\nDoes usbnet_init get called before there is any entropy?\nIs the entropy for the PRNG actually unreliable/missing this early (e.g. there is no RTC and no physical ethernet)\n\nEither way, as a module there is enough of a delay for eth_random_addr to return some slightly random data for us, so link local addressing works, so my python code works. Hurrah.\nAlso given the driver allocates a single random mac address at boot (or module load time) does this mean you can't plug multiple usbnet cables into the same linux box?\n","id":"https://unrouted.uk/blog/usbnet-randomness/","title":"Random MAC Addresses That Aren't"},"https://unrouted.uk/blog/use-make/":{"body":"AWS Lambda is conceptually really cool but as soon as your code creeps beyond a single python file that uses botocore things start to get messy and cumbersome. It's tempting to add an entirely new tool to your workflow, but theres really no need. The approach I use is good old make.\n\nIt's a perfect fit really. We have input files:\n\nA requirements.txt or some other definition of our dependencies\nSome code that is checked in along side the requirements.txt\nPossibly some configuration that needs to be bundled alongside the code\nAn entrypoint - such as lambda_handler.py\n\nWe want to take these and assemble a lambda.zip.\nOne of the nice things about this setup is that when you run make it will only update the things that have changed. This means that the requirements.txt gather step only needs to be run once - rebuilding the zip files can actually be really quick.\nMake 101\nIf you are familiar with how a Makefile is plumbed together you can skip this bit. A Makefile is a collection of build targets and the rules for how to build those targets.\n\nIn this example, lambda.zip is the target. make is responsible for generating that target, and if any of the dependencies listed (lambda_handler.py in this example) are newer than lambda.zip it knows it needs to recreate the zip.\nOne very important thing is that a Makefile must be tab indented.\nSometimes there isn't a single file that is generated by a build step. Sometimes there might not even be a file. For example, you might want to upload a build artifact only when something has changed. The make idiom for this is to use a stamp file. A stamp file is a 0 byte marker that indicates some process has been completed at a give date and time. So for example:\n\nThe build target is upload.stamp. The target needs building every time lambda.zip is updated. awscli is used to do a code upload, then touch $@ creates the stamp file (or updates its modification timestamp). This upload is now idempotent.\nThere are some special rules in make. These are rules that don't have targets on disk. For example, make clean. Without some configuration hint make would believe that you wanted to create a file called clean. If you happened to have a file called clean then make would think that the build was up to date and that it didn't need to clean anything. What this means is that we need targets that are always built. These are called .PHONY targets, and you need to include a declaration in your Makefile like this:\n\nBasic Makefile structure\nWe'll look at the basic skaffold first before delving into specifics.\nI declare a bunch of paths at the top of my Makefile. They are all relative to the cwd which i grab with $(shell pwd):\n\nThe all target defines what should happen if you just run make with no arguments. We let make know about our .PHONY rules too:\n\nmake clean needs to delete any files that were created by running make:\n\nWe have a build step to generate a staging directory when the lambda_handler.py code changes:\n\nAnd then we zip it up as $cwd/build/lambda.zip:\n\nCollecting and extracting wheels\nWe want to collect all the eggs in requirements.txt. We'll use the pip wheel command to do any compilation and build a wheelhouse. Subsequent builds can reuse the same wheels and avoid compilation:\n\nWe want to preserve the built wheels as much as we can, but we don't have a mechanism to purge old wheels. Because we want to be able to get just the wheels related to the current requirements.txt we use a second wheelhouse that we delete before repopulating it. By using the first wheelhouse as a --find-links this is pretty much a straight copy and fast:\n\nNow the best part of collecting wheels like this is that we can just unzip them into the build directory and they will be in the correct location:\n\nReproducibility and Idempotence\nOne nice property of this is theoretically if a build is run twice on the same base OS then you should get the same output, bit for bit. And this should mean use can use the CodeSha256 property returned from the Lambda API to not only prove what is deployed is what you think it is but also build in idempotence. However its not that simple.\nIf your zip building process is not creating identical output you can use the Debian diffoscope utility to help figure out what went wrong. Here are some things we spotted and fixed.\nFirst we need to add an extra parameter to our zip incantation:\n\nThis turns on --no-extra mode. This tells zip to ignore non-essential extra file attributes. By default these extra attributes introduce some non-determinism, so we just get rid of them.\nNext up is that when a wheel is unpacked the mtime of the directories that are created are the current time. This metadata is preserved in the zip, but isn't interesting or useful to us. I pick an arbitrary date (in this case the mtime of the last commit) and clamp the modification timestamps:\n\nThe next problem are .so files that are generated by the build process. Hopefully you don't have any, in which case you are done. Right now if you run a setup.py based compilation of an .so twice you will get different outputs. Some of this is the use of random /tmp directories. Right now the easiest way to work around this is just to pre-compile your binary dependencies as wheels and upload them to a private repository. The right fix involves using the learnings of the Reproducible Builds team to make python wheels repeatable.\nYou should now have reproducible lambda zips.\nBonus targets\nAs alluded to earlier, we can upload the zip directly to AWS by calling out to awscli. And why not add a make invoke to deploy, upload and run our function?\n\nBecause of the dependencies invoke will build a new lambda.zip if somethings changed and then deploy it, before finally running it.
