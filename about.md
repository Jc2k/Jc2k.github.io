I'm the resident Systems Specialist at [Isotoma](https://www.isotoma.com/). I build high availability cloud applications for Amazon Web Services. I do security, performance and reliability and deployment automation.

I build DevOps tooling like [touchdown](http://docs.yaybu.com/projects/touchdown/).

I dabble in Django - mostly working to better integrate it into Isotoma's standard AWS setup.

I <3 noodles.

My GPG key is at [keybase.io](https://keybase.io/jc2k), or [here](/john-carr.asc).
