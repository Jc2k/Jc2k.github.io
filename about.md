I'm the resident Systems Specialist at [Isotoma](https://www.isotoma.com/). I build high availability cloud applications for Amazon Web Services. I do security, performance and reliability and deployment automation.

I build DevOps tooling like [touchdown](http://docs.yaybu.com/projects/touchdown/).

I dabble in Django - mostly working to better integrate it into Isotoma's standard AWS setup.

I :heart: noodles.
