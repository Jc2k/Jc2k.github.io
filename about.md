I'm currently working for a European public benefit organisation in the IT security sector.

I've previously worked as a Systems Specialist at [Isotoma](https://www.isotoma.com/) where I built high availability cloud applications on Amazon Web Services.

I do security, performance, reliability and deployment automation engineering.

I build DevOps tooling like [touchdown](http://docs.yaybu.com/projects/touchdown/).

I dabble in Django, and grudgingly hit React with sticks until it does what I want.

I :heart: noodles.


## GPG

My GPG key is at [keybase.io](https://keybase.io/jc2k), or [here](/gpg/key.txt).

I am no longer using the key [0xD7714D55E6EEB4D9](https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=vindex&search=0xD7714D55E6EEB4D9), see my [transition statement](/gpg/transitions/20140527.txt).
