Tomorrow we move to Git! If I could offer you one piece of advice, git config would be it. Just a simple:

    git config --global user.name "Your Name Comes Here"
    git config --global user.email you@yourdomain.example.com

on every new machine you use Git on. Otherwise the history is going to look like crap (look at the email address).

    commit 9dea54aab2c97181f8d8c67a8cdce956baa30d05
    Author: Gnome User <gnome@ubuntu-desktop.(none)>
    Date:   Tue Apr 7 10:17:13 2009 +1200

That is all.
