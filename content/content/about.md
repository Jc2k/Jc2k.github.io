I'm Jc2k - üå±-based coffee loving Dad from Yorkshire.

I currently work for a nonprofit dedicated to making the internet a safer and more secure place for everyone.

I'm a committer at [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/), self-hosted home automation that puts local control and privacy first. I maintain a couple of integrations there:

* [HomeKit Device](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/homekit_controller/) lets you use any "Works with Apple HomeKit" IoT accessories (including WiFi, Bluetooth and Thread) directly from Home Assistant, even if you don't own any Apple devices.
* [Xiaomi BLE](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/xiaomi_ble/) lets you use your Xiaomi Bluetooth sensors directly with HA, without their gateway or app.
* [Private BLE](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/private_ble_device/) lets you use your iOS devices for home/away presence tracking without making yourself trackable or increasing your battery usage.
* [EAFM](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/eafm/) lets you know if your local river is about to flood.

I'm a committer at [Music Assistant](https://music-assistant.io/) a music library manager for your offline and online music sources which can stream music to a bunch of supported players and be combined with Home Assistant.

I used to contribute to [libcloud](www.libcloud.org), [buildbot](www.buildbot.net) and [GNOME](https://www.gnome.org).
