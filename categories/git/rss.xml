          <description xml:base="https://unrouted.uk/blog/git-and-walking-tags/">&lt;p&gt;I recently built a visualisation of all Django migrations in a project and the dependencies between them. I was most interested in recent migrations, and in particular if a migration had been changed after it had been deployed. So adding the tag a migration was introduced in (and the tag it was last modified in) seemed like a good idea.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
